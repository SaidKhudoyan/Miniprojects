Imagine you want to compare the files(ignoring their file-extensions) in two different folders with each other and you don't want to compare them manually.

Since that would just be insane to do so, this little program provides you with a very simple Interface to choose the two folders and compare the files.
Afterwards it will copy the different files into a target folder, which you again can choose from the Interface.

On the other hand, if you want to delete the different files , you can instead add 1-2 lines to do so.

Here is a small overview of the program:
------------------------------------------------------
1. Choose the two folders you want to compare:

------------------------------------------------------
2. Show different files: Afterwards you will be asked, if you want to see which files are different. If the answer is yes, it will show e.g :

------------------------------------------------------
3. Next you will be asked if you want to copy the different files to another folder, if yes, you have to choose a target directory, there a new folder with the different files will be created.

------------------------------------------------------
4. At the end the folder was created and the different files were copied into the new folder. Here is an example:
